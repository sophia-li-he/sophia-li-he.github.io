For example, from East and West Coasts, where cola preference is the same. The statistic is the &lt;strong&gt;difference in the proportion&lt;/strong&gt; of West Coast people who prefer cola as compared with the proportion of East Coast people who prefer cola. The difference in the sample proportion changes within each sample.
We can build a distribution of &lt;strong&gt;differences in proportions&lt;/strong&gt; assuming the null hypothesis, that there is no link between location and soda preference, is true. That is, the null samples consist of randomly shuffled soda variables so that the samples don't have any dependency between location and soda preference.
